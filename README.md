# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

My motivation is to seek a new career as a web developer, and personal enrichment along the way.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a 
homework assignment.")

I built this to help me get a small grasp on what we will be working on throughout the course and to reference the little work i did here as a reminder of where I started out to where I will be in the future

- What problem does it solve?

It helps me practice the basic codes that we will be learning and provide a reference to the building blocks that allow me to code. 
- What did you learn?
I learned small amounts about HTML, JavaScript, Git, and CSS that sets the foundation for my future learning

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
